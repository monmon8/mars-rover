# mars-rover

### Requirements

create a program to move rovers around the surface of Mars!

### How to run

1. clone this repo
2. run `npm`
3. run `npm test `

### Process of thought

I am building the robot app using 3 main functions:

- createMap: A function responsible for finding the map.

- initialPosition: A function responsible for finding the initial position.
- robot: A function responsible for setting up the robot to begin with, and then receiving instructions and moving the robot based on these instructions.

### Future thoughts

- Refactor all the if statement in robot file in a sperate function
- Do the edge cases forexample: check the movemnets and make sure that the robot doesnt mpve outside the map.
